This is a fork of Benjamin Vedders Open Source VESC project: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc-hardware

## Goals: 
The original Vesc design is very good for the things it wants to do. I want to do different things and still be able to use the same firmware. So I made this version.

The idea was that I only wanted to drive very weak motors. So this version is cheap and not that good. :man_shrugging:
